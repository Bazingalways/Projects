Or even Dr. Mahesh Panchagnula, who has undertaken several projects with premier organisations in areas such as spray atomisation and fluid systems design.\nAnd as a student of IIT Madras, you’ll always have ample opportunities to use your knowledge and dig deeper into niche topics of your interest as well. The possibilities are endless indeed!\nThe Computational Edge\nThe real magic of CEM lies in its computational focus. In today’s world, almost every engineering challenge involves massive data processing and complex simulations. CEM graduates aren’t just prepared for this reality—they thrive in it.\n“Any hardware industry that truly wants to innovate, or even keep a good pipeline of products with low R&D overheads needs to invest in simulation, building digital twins and have data management and AI first approach. The program promises to provide foundational engineering as well as applying those skills in computation and data science is a big win for industry.”\n- Pranav Chopra, 2006 IITM Alum\nIndustry leaders are already excited about CEM graduates. Santhoji Katare, a Ford General Manager, highlighted the need for exactly this blend of domain knowledge and data science skills. Whereas, Sanjay Vijayaraghavan, a principal engineer at GE Aerospace sees CEM as mirroring its prestigious Edison engineer program.\nAs one other alumnus put it, these skills extend beyond traditional engineering roles into areas like quantitative finance and data science. It’s engineering versatility for the digital age. So, yes, as aptly recognised by industry experts, this is the go-to program for those who aspire today to build solutions for tomorrow.\nWhat Are You Waiting For?\nLike any other B.Tech course at IIT Madras, you can easily apply for the B.Tech in CEM program through JOSAA during the counselling rounds after clearing JEE Advanced.

        "answer": "During his time at IIT Madras, Aravind, an EE student, discovered the world of machine learning through friends in computer science and an encouraging guide, Professor Ravindran, who championed cross-departmental learning.\n‍\n“I learned about deep learning, RL, all these things before. Now it's obviously the hot thing. At that time it was not, and IIT Madras was probably the only campus at that time that even had a professor working in AI and machine learning.  So that clearly made a big difference in my life. If I fell somewhere else, I would not have been doing what I'm doing right now.” said  Mr. Aravind Srinivas, the founder of Perplexity AI.\n‍\nAravind in his first year failed to switch majors to computer science. However, this setback turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as his background in electrical engineering provided a strong foundation in the essential concepts for machine learning. He credits a Python programming class taught by a forward-thinking professor for equipping him with the Python-centric world of ML.  “Nobody was really into Python that much in IIT at the time, and he was very prescient, and that helped me a lot, because obviously, ML is largely being done in Python,” said Aravind. He fondly recalls late-night study sessions with friends at IIT Madras, bonding over assignments and contemplating the future during leisurely walks. These moments of camaraderie and shared academic pursuits shaped his experience at the institution.\nThis early exposure to deep learning and reinforcement learning, at a time when AI was still in its nascent stages, laid the foundation for Aravind's future endeavors. During his time at IIT Madras, Aravind published in top tier AI conferences like International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and NeurIPS. Aravind collaborated with Prof. Ravindran B and Prof. Mitesh Khapra at IIT Madras, and had a total of 9 papers published. Aravind later went to University of California Berkeley for his PhD to work on problems in reinforcement learning, generative models and representation learning. After graduating from Berkeley in 2021, Aravind worked at OpenAI on language and diffusion text models. In 2022, Aravind co-founded Perplexity AI which recently joined the unicorn club.

        "answer": "Founded in 2024, the Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI (WSAI) is home to the 18th and newest department (Department of Data Science and AI) at IIT Madras. The department will start with fifteen full-time faculty members, making it\nthe largest AI department across all 23 IITs.\nThe department offers a\nBTech in AI & Data Analytics\n, an amazing opportunity to dive into the world of artificial intelligence and data analytics. This unique interdisciplinary program offers a comprehensive foundation in AI technologies and various aspects of data analytics, preparing you for a dynamic career in various industries, and also for graduate studies.\nThe first few semesters of the course will focus on imparting foundational knowledge in mathematics and statistics. Starting from probability theory, linear algebra, optimization, till programming fundamentals, along with basic sciences. The second year would introduce students to Machine Learning and AI fundamentals. The goal here is to ensure students are aware of all the modeling paradigms. There are so many deep learning architectures ranging from a humble convolutional neural network to GANs, so it is essential to have a detailed idea of various learning algorithms and really understand these model architectures.\nThe next stage would be to help students wrap up these foundations and learn how to train these models on data, followed by practical deployment of these models. The third year would focus on more advanced topics in ML, like Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Along with the core courses, students will be required to take electives in one of the two core baskets. One basket is all about traditional applications of AI like language and vision while the other would focus on more systems oriented aspects like manufacturing systems or process control oriented applications of data science and AI.\nIn the final year, there will be a course introducing the principles of responsible design in AI along with unallotted credits for other electives. In the curriculum, there will also be courses to help students integrate everything that they have learned and apply it to a domain of their choice, be it through course projects or a thesis. The goal of this program is to not repair a computer science curriculum, but look at it as a ground up design for not just learning about AI but about building deployable AI systems.",

        "answer": "IIT Madras was established in 1959. Since then, it has regularly implemented changes to its academic system to remain an attractive destination for students. Here are some changes that will take effect in 2024 and some context around those changes.\nNew Program\nWe are now offering a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA). This program is offered by our newest department, The Wadhwani School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI). With this addition, we now offer 15 programs as seen on the JoSAA portal.\nBranch Change discontinued\nEarlier, based on performance, a few select students could change their branch in their first year. This “branch change” system has now been discontinued. The current IIT Madras academic system offers students a very high degree of flexibility in their choice of courses via the elective system. Students can choose between 40-50% of their courses, including courses from any other department. Students can also opt for a “minor” or switch to an “IDDD” (Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree). Because of this flexibility, the branch change system is no longer as useful as it used to be.\nReduced academic workload\nThe number of credits a student must complete to graduate has been reduced from 432 to 400. This eases the academic workload by almost 10%.\nImproved first-year experience\nWorkshops for first-year students, previously held during the vacation period, have been re-integrated into the semester, adding two more weeks of vacation time. Furthermore, a compulsory recreation course (Pass/Fail, 2 credits) has been introduced for students in the first two semesters, promoting a healthy work-life balance.\nEntrepreneurship Elective\nIIT Madras has always had a thriving entrepreneurship environment. Recognising this, we have decided to offer an entrepreneurship elective course in the third/fourth semester for interested students.\nElective Semester\nThe sixth semester (for B.Tech) and eighth semester (for Dual Degree) will have no compulsory courses. Students may take electives, a semester-long internship, or a semester exchange. This flexibility will allow students to broaden their interests and skills.\nEarly Exit Options\nIIT Madras has also introduced an early exit option for students who may wish to pursue alternative paths. Students can leave with a “B.Sc in General Engineering.”\nWhy are we offering this? Students join IITs after much effort and are very excited in the first year. In a few cases, these students may decide that engineering is not their calling and want to switch paths. For them, this option will mean that they can leave early.\nWhen we look at how our students are shaping their careers—whether in industry or academia—it is clear that they will benefit from the increased flexibility. This academic flexibility is one of the reasons why IIT Madras is called the best place to build. Students can build their skills, careers, products, startups, or … friendships.\nDiscussion\nDiscuss these changes on the\ncommunity page\n.",

        "answer": "About the Tech Meet:\nThe Inter IIT Tech Meet is a pan-IIT technical contest, which witnesses students across various IITs in the country working to come up with impactful solutions to problems that could impact millions. India is currently facing unprecedented challenges, and the best way to overcome these challenges is by bringing together the most innovative and ingenious minds. The Tech Meet is truly a colloquium of the best minds across the country.\nVision and Past Sponsors:\nThe Inter IIT Tech Meet has been a platform for the brightest minds in technology from the premier IITs to come together and solve real-world problems. During the Inter IIT Tech Meet, companies usually provide challenging problem statements to the IITs, who build teams to work on these for some time before finally showcasing them at the final offline Meet. Some of the Tech Meet's previous sponsors include DRDO, ISRO, Adobe, WorldQuant, Jaguar Land Rover, Bosch, Silicon Labs, to name a few.\nHistory:\nThe first edition of the Inter IIT Tech Meet was held in 2012. Since then, it has morphed into the most awaited technical event for all the IITs. In recent years, the Meet has gained prominence with its ever-growing participants' fierce dedication and efforts. IIT Madras hosted the most recent (12th) edition of the Tech Meet, which had a footfall of nearly 2,000 students from all the 23 IITs. IIT Madras has a rich legacy, having had an overall podium finish once and a podium finish in several events each year. More notably, the AI Contingent from IITM has had consecutive podium finishes at the Tech Meet over the past three editions.\nEvents and Domains:\nThe various events at Inter IIT Tech Meet can be classified mainly into four categories:\nHigh Prep:\nHigh Prep events constitute a formidable part of the Meet and have the maximum points attached. A typical High Prep event demands a highly skilled group of individuals working on multiple tasks for roughly 6-8 weeks.\nMid Prep:\nMid prep events are more straightforward than high prep events, with a more focused yet challenging goal and a span of between 4 and 6 weeks.\nLow Prep:\nLow Prep events require a set of individuals highly skilled in a particular domain. This fast-paced event poses a unique challenge, and the teams are given about 6-10 days to work.\nNo Prep:\nNo Prep events require continuous efforts from the participants over 24 hours. Ideally, the participants are given a detailed problem statement when they arrive at the venue.\nThe problem statements (events) are also divided into various sub-domains like AI, Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Sustainability, Aeronautics, Quant, Entrepreneurship, and Product Development, among many others. With challenging problem statements in various emerging domains, the Tech Meet has also been quite successful at bridging the gap between industry and academia.\nOther Inter-IIT competitions include the\nInter-IIT Sports Meet\nand\nInter-IIT Cultural Meet\n.\nShare your thoughts on the\nAskIITM Community\n.",

        "answer": "'Core profile', 'non-core companies', etc., are terms that you are very likely to encounter even during your early days at IIT Madras. But, what exactly do these terms mean? Let's simplify all the jargon surrounding these terms.\nThese terms have significant relevance in the context of internships and\nplacements\n. The distinction between core and non-core companies (or profiles) is often made to categorize companies based on their relevance to specific engineering disciplines.\nCore companies (or profiles) are those related to the core engineering disciplines, such as electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical, and so on. Core companies often recruit engineers from specific branches of engineering, matching their expertise with the company's needs. For instance, the Mechanical Engineering department collaborates with several core engineering companies such as Hindustan Unilever, ITC Limited, and P&G, among others; these companies also provide abundant internship opportunities. Students interested in their respective core engineering disciplines are inclined to sit for these companies. Most core roles are only open to students from the relevant departments.\nNon-core companies may not directly be related to core engineering disciplines but would still require expertise in a specific domain. Companies that work in sectors such as IT, finance, consulting, software development, etc., are often classified as non-core companies. For instance, companies like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley recruit for roles related to investment banking. Such roles are usually open to students from a wide range of departments (if not all).\nIn short, core companies are more sought after by students from core engineering branches for jobs related to their field of study. In contrast, non-core companies offer a broader range of opportunities that may appeal to students from various academic backgrounds.\nShare your thoughts on the\nAskIITM Community\n.",

        ],
        "answer": "Aside from sitting for placements, students can explore several options after completing their degree at IIT Madras. Some of the most popular options among students are:\nHigher Studies\n: IIT graduates have a wealth of options when it comes to continuing their education. Many choose to pursue postgraduate degrees (Master's in Technology, Master of Science, Master of Business Administration, etc.) in India or abroad. The reputation of IITs is well-respected by esteemed universities worldwide, often granting graduates access to top programs. For those with a passion for in-depth research and a career in academia, enrolling in a Ph.D. program can be incredibly fulfilling. Ph.D. graduates can further specialise through postdoctoral fellowships, conducting advanced research with funding and support from universities or research organisations around the globe.\nGovernment & Public Sector\n: IIT graduates have a remarkable range of career paths beyond engineering. For those driven by public service, prestigious civil service positions like IAS, IFS, and IPS offer the chance to make a lasting impact on national governance and development. Additionally, Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) actively seek IIT engineers and MBAs, recruiting top talent through competitive exams like GATE. These PSUs provide fulfilling careers tackling large-scale projects that contribute to the nation's infrastructure and development.\nEntrepreneurship\n: IIT Madras cultivates a prime environment for aspiring student entrepreneurs through a rigorous technical education and a vibrant innovation ecosystem. At the forefront of this ecosystem is the IIT Madras Incubation Cell, a one-stop shop for budding startups. From seed funding to dedicated workspaces, the Incubation Cell provides a comprehensive toolkit to turn ideas into thriving commercial ventures. Network with experienced mentors and tap into a vast alumni network, creating a launchpad for your journey.\nSocial Impact\n: Putting your engineering or business expertise to work on social challenges can be incredibly rewarding. NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations) address critical issues in education, healthcare,, and rural development, and they need skilled professionals to make a difference. Contributing your talents to an NGO can be a meaningful way to connect with your passions and make a positive impact. Fellowship programs like Teach for India, the Gandhi Fellowship, etc. provide excellent pathways to launch a fulfilling career tackling social issues.\nAlong with these, some students also choose to defer placements by one year in order to gain experience in the professional field, work on specific entrepreneurial projects or start-ups, or even take a gap year.\nWhat else do you want to learn about?

        "answer": "IIT Madras is a residential institute offering accommodation for all students who opt for it across 20 hostels named after India's major rivers. There are 15 hostels for male students and 5 for female students.\nFirst-year undergraduates are provided sharing-style accommodation, while senior undergraduates may receive single, double, or triple rooms, depending on the hostel. Postgraduate students have options for sharing or single rooms.\nProvided below are the details regarding every hostel of IIT Madras -\nMandakini A & B -\nIt is the male freshie hostel, which only consists of shared rooms. Mandakini is renowned for its height, amazing views and amenities. All students are provided with either a two-person or three-person sharing room, which are spacious and comfortable. Mandakini was recently built and consists of several amenities such as multiple laundry rooms in every wing of every floor, badminton courts, reading rooms, common rooms, etc.\nCauvery -\nCauvery Hostel is considered as the sophomore hostel, once being the freshie hostel before Mandakini’s inauguration,  and like Mandakini is well known for its comfort and amenities. Inside the hostel are multiple playgrounds, mini football fields, a batting cage, and along with it, multiple laundry rooms, common rooms, etc. While Mandakini stands out because of its architectural significance, Cauvery is where every student gets exposed to the vibes of hostel life.\nBrahmaputra -\nLike Cauvery, Brahmaputra is also a sophomore hostel, smaller in size but equally comfortable and vibeful. Brahmaputra is secluded from most other hostels, located behind Tapti Hostel, and is renowned for the closeness and camaraderie of its residents. Brahmaputra is currently undergoing renovations, and also contains a well maintained kitchen and music room.\nAlaknanda -\nAlaknanda is the hostel situated closest to the Taramani Gate of IIT Madras. Alaknanda contains the same facilities as the previously mentioned hostels, and stands out because of its cleanliness and hostel vibes.\nGanga -\nLocated just a few metres away from Mandakini, Ganga is one of the cleanest and most comfortable hostels to reside in. On account of its recent renovation, Ganga residents find themselves with updated washroom facilities, more amenities, and fewer monkeys, making the hostel an old gem repolished.\nJamuna -\nJamuna, located parallel to the Ganga Hostel, is a sharer of the same fate. Recently renovated, Jamuna is a very clean hostel, with several amenities, but unlike Ganga, is also filled with monkeys around the building.\nGodavari -\nAnother recently renovated hostel, Godavari shares all the characteristics previously mentioned. But unlike the other hostels, Godavari is privileged in being located near the Himalaya Mess and Food Court, increasing its desirability.\nKrishna -\nKrishna has the unique feature of being located in very close proximity to the Nilgiri Mess, and also contains beautiful gardens and a park inside it.\nNarmada -\nNarmada Hostel might not have been renovated as of yet, and it might not contain the same amount of amenities, but is renowned for its passionate cultural representation in inter-hostel events, and is also located just opposite to the Rotterman Food Truck, which provide its residents with cheap food options far late at night.\nSaraswati -\nSaraswati Hostel is not just renovated, or clean, or filled with amenities, but is also located in the prime spot opposite to Quark (consists of Zaitoon and a hangout spot) facing the Sangam grounds. Students can travel from their rooms at Saras to grab a bite, watch part of a football game and then travel to Taramani Gate, and be done within a span of five minutes.\nTapti -\nTapti Hostel, while housing the same amenities and facilities, sets itself apart with two unique characteristics - i) Air Conditioned Common Room & ii) Cycle Repair Shop. Having these in such close proximity allows Tapti residents to enjoy their stay during the hot days of summer when it's impossible to stay outside, and during the rainy seasons when it's impossible to travel to repair your cycle. Tapti also houses its own gymnasium.\nTamiraparani / Sindhu / Pampa / Mahanadhi -\nDesignated as the “Tower Hostels”, these hostels specifically house graduate students, and only consist of single rooms for each resident, allowing them to focus on their studies while enjoying their own personal space.\nSwarnamukhi -\nLike Mandakini, Swarnamuhi is a recently-constructed fresher’s hostel, only housing first-year female students. Swarnamukhi is renowned for its amenities, its cleanliness, its proximity to CLT, the Central Library, Cafe Coffee Day, Ellora Hangout Spot, and the Ajanta Reading Room Extension.\nSharavati -\nOpposite to USHA Cafe and close to Vindhya Mess, Sharavati stands as another culturally enriched hostel, with history of successful inter-hostel participations and enjoys several amenities like the aforementioned hostels.\nTunga / Bhadra -\nTwo “Tower Hostels”, located just opposite to the Cauvery Mess, near Nilgiri Mess, Tunga & Bhadra, house both graduate and senior undergraduate students, who all enjoy living in single rooms, and are accustomed to several facilities and amenities.\nSabarmati -\nHousing specifically female graduate students and researchers, Sabarmati is located in close proximity to the Open Air Theatre, and USHA Cafe, providing its residents with both sources of sustenance and entertainment.\nThe hostel rooms have essential furniture: a table, chair, shelf, bed frame (mattress not included), and an almirah for storage. Each room features an overhead fan, multiple lights, and a high-speed LAN network with multiple ports for shared accommodations. Students must purchase their own LAN cables.\nCommon restrooms are available on each floor. A cluster of 7-8 rooms shares washing machines, both automatic and semi-automatic. Students are responsible for their own laundry and room maintenance. While cleaning staff maintain common areas, including restrooms, corridors, and floors, students must clean their own rooms. Hostel management is available to assist with pre-existing issues with dirt or paint. Most hostels also feature 24/7 vending machines. For any concerns, students can contact the hostel manager, who is committed to ensuring prompt resolution.\nWhich is your favorite? Tell us on our\ncommunity\n!",

        "answer": "IITM has a vast campus, and navigating it can be quite daunting, especially for the first time. Most students use bicycles (also a convenient mode of transport) to move around the campus due to the presence of bicycle-friendly paths.\nThe Institute provides bus transport facilities within the campus. Four regular buses and ten battery-powered vehicles, named after mountain ranges and peaks in India, come every 20-30 minutes between the Main Gate, Gajendra Circle (GC), Hostel Zone and Velachery Gate. These buses operate from 6 AM to 10 PM. More recently, EV-powered AC buses have also started operating around the campus (thanks to our esteemed alumni!).\nRecently, the Institute has also started shuttle services (E-Carts) within the campus to help students, faculty, and staff move between different departments, hostels, and other campus facilities. There are special shuttle services available for female students beyond 10 PM as well.  This has become a ubiquitous mode of transport for students who might be travelling with a lot of luggage.\nWhile less common than the other modes, some students also use personal vehicles like motorcycles to commute to and from the campus. There are designated parking areas for personal vehicles on the campus.\nAlong with the ways mentioned above to commute around the Institute, some students also prefer to walk around the lush campus (especially if there are no classes to attend).\nDiscuss on the\nAskIITM Community\n!",

        "answer": "Electives are courses or subjects students can study based on their interests or career goals. Unlike mandatory or core courses, which are required for graduation or to fulfil specific academic requirements, electives allow students the flexibility to explore different areas of study outside of their major or core curriculum.\nSome of the popular electives at IITM taken by students from all departments are:\nPrinciples of Economics,\noffered by the Humanities and Social Sciences department, is a popular humanities elective. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to economics, exploring the fundamental principles that shape consumer and producer behaviour. You'll learn how markets function, the laws of supply and demand, and the different types of markets. It also delves into market failures and the government's role in the economy and tackles key macroeconomic issues like inflation and unemployment.\nFrench and German\nlanguage courses are also amongst the most chosen humanities electives. They are beginner-friendly and equip students with conversational and listening skills in the respective foreign languages.\nPattern Recognition and Machine Learning\nis offered by the Computer Science and Engineering department. The course brushes up on linear algebra fundamentals required and introduces machine learning techniques for solving pattern recognition tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. Students can also solidify their knowledge through hands-on assignments and a data contest.\nMathematical Foundations of Data Science\n, offered by the Chemical Engineering department, is the most popular course data science enthusiasts take. It introduces students to the fundamental mathematical concepts required for a program in data science. The course content covers the basics of data science, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and random processes and optimization.\nMaterials in Renewable Energy Technologies\n, offered by the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department, discusses materials used for various energy conversion and energy storage devices. Prof. Prathap Haridoss, the course instructor, also invites industry professionals to give students a flavour of renewable energy technology companies and products.\nStudents also often choose online NPTEL courses such as Non-Conventional Energy Resources, Fundamentals of Electronic Materials and Devices, Applied Time-Series Analysis, and Introduction to Machine Learning.\nOf course, this is a very small list.

        "answer": "Branch change is the process of switching from the branch you joined to another after your first year. From the 2024 batch onwards, the branch change system will\nNOT\nbe available at IIT Madras.\nWhy do JEE aspirants look for a branch change option?\nFor many students who got a rank less than they wanted, the branch change system felt like a second chance. If they work very hard in the first semester, they may be able to change to a branch open only to higher ranks, like CSE. But this option is available to very few students since a branch size can change only by 10%. Only 4-5 people would get into CSE via branch change at IIT Madras.\n‍\nWhy is IIT Madras not offering branch change?\nOver the years, IIT Madras has introduced many student-friendly changes to the academic system, which has resulted in a very high degree of academic flexibility. Students in a particular branch can choose to go deep into their core field or widen their skills and expertise outside that field.\nThe formal course selection itself is flexible via\nelectives\n,\nminors\n, and\nInterdisciplinary Dual Degree\n(IDDD) programs.\nMost opportunities on campus - PoRs and internships - do not discriminate based on branch and are open to all branches.\nMost companies that recruit from IIT Madras open their placement process to students from all branches, especially in CS/IT/Consulting/Product Management and similar non-core roles. However, deeply specialised roles may be closed. For example, VLSI companies might look for CSE-VLSI engineers only, and Oil and gas companies may look for Chemical engineers only.\nThe IITM calendar gives much vacation time to pursue internships - almost 3 months in Summer and 1 month in Winter.\nPlus, one of the semesters is made up of only electives - which means you can take on a full-semester internship!\nIn this context, the branch change system is simply not as useful as it was earlier. And therefore, it has been discontinued at IIT Madras.\nDo I need branch change to explore CS, Elec or Mech?\nAt IIT Madras, you do not need to be a CS student to take CS courses because of the flexible academic system.\nSay you’re an Ocean Engineering student interested in Computer Science. You can choose to do electives in CS courses, club electives together to do a minor from CS, or maybe even convert your four-year degree program into a five-year program by pursuing an IDDD in Data Science, for example. The same goes for a CS student interested in Robotics, or a Civil Engineering student interested in Management.\nDo other IITs offer branch change?\nEach IIT takes it’s own decision regarding branch change depending upon their academic system.

        "answer": "The NDE5.0 (Non Destructive Evaluation) Centre for Excellence focuses on the examination of structures and materials using non-invasive methods, much like modern medical tools like x-ray and ultrasound. Industrial assets age, and with age develop vulnerability points. Through early detection and mitigation of faults, the program works on prevention of catastrophic failure and reduction of downtime. For example, India’s extensive railroad system faces constant stress and abuse at the hands of overloaded networks with hundreds of high speed trains plying on the same lines. How does one guarantee the safety of passengers and goods traversing such stressed systems? Through ultrasonic analysis, the condition of cracks and fractures on the tracks can be evaluated and potential rupture points can be detected. Over the course of an year, the team discovered and rectified more than 2000 critical fracture points in the Southern Railway network alone, thereby preventing tens of thousands of possible derailments.\nNon-Destructive Evaluation is not an alien concept. The challenge posed at the centre today is the speed, economy and accessibility of such an evaluation at scale. Keeping with the latest norms of ‘\nIndustry 4.0\n’, the centre has made leaps in improvisation of analysis through AI (artificial intelligence), IoT (internet of things) and robotic integration. WIth the advent of ‘\nIndustry 5.0\n’, the centre envisions advancements in five key areas: ubiquitous sensing, structured materials, swarm robotics, AI for computation, and collaboration with international universities and labs.\nThrough its research avenues in contactless ultrasonic testing using metamaterials, to thermography for surface anomaly detection and deep learning algorithms for defect detection, the team strives to revolutionise non-destructive evaluation.\nOver the past decade, NDE5.0 has emerged a leader in the field of structural analysis. With fundamental research finding its way into international PhD theses and technologies being adopted in industries across the line, NDE5.0 has direct influence in 12 countries spanning 4 continents. With thorough collaboration with international agencies, labs as well as universities, the centre gives students an exposure to the work being done here as well as sends students abroad to observe research being done elsewhere.\nThe team has incubated over 10 startups in the last ten years. From novel IOT sensor development in\nXyma Analytics\nto critical pipeline fault detection at\nSolinas\n, to\nPlanys\n’ advanced submarine robotic inspection tools, to\nDetect Tech’s\nautonomous aerial drone based inspection systems, the team packs promising entrepreneurial spirit.\nDiscuss the CoEs on our\ncommunity\n.",

        "answer": "The ME2ME Centre of Excellence (COE) at the Dept of Ocean Engineering at IIT Madras aims at bridging the gap between controlled lab-scale experiments and actual field work of the maritime industry. Through three broadly classified facets, the COE works to revolutionize the field of autonomy and digitization of maritime operations:\nAutonomy and AI: Self-sustained, controlled water-based EVs and vessels\nCollection of large scale real-time coastal and deep-sea data\nAutonomy and digitization of ports and docks for efficient and error-free movement of goods and people\nDespite all the advancements in the industry, more than 80% of maritime accidents happen due to human error. By reducing human intervention, automation drastically reduces that number and makes complex maritime operations both safe and efficient. Further, through numerous sensor driven control algorithms, autonomous systems can chart out a safer and more energy efficient route, thereby cutting costs and making operations more eco-friendly.\nAutonomy in various domains, such as defense surveillance, commercial offshore intervention, and coastal surveillance, has proven to be useful. It offers benefits like improved disaster management, control algorithms, and automation. It is particularly attractive for commercial purposes due to its potential for reducing crew members, minimizing human error, and enhancing safety in challenging maritime situations.\nAutonomy is already being implemented on a smaller scale, with large-scale maritime surveys conducted via drones and the launch of a remote-controlled electric cargo ship in Norway, which reduced traffic and pollution by displacing 40000 trucks from land. However, despite all advancements in technology, its widespread application faces obstacles, primarily in the form of regulations. Determining liability in unforeseen incidents, deciding who controls the ship, and addressing concerns of foreign control are among the challenges that need to be addressed.\nME2ME’s current focus is on development of control navigation and guidance systems for vessels, while optimizing on efficiency and obstacle avoidance. Through navigation systems that interface with sensors placed around ships, ME2ME develops software that makes necessary path corrections and movements. Through its fleet of three operational vehicles, the first of which was fabricated in-house at the Central Workshop at IITM, ME2ME receives constant field feedback on the performance of its algorithms and controls.\nUnder its guidance, a student-led competitive team\nArithra\n(Sanskrit for navigation) finished 5th internationally in Nord, a virtual design competition. This year, the team eyes a podium finish in the offline rendition of the same scheduled to be held in Norway.\nAs of today, India lags behind the likes of South Korea, Norway and UK in development of such systems, mainly due to lack of industrial participation. However, a forecasted interest in startups as well as policy makers might prove to shift the global landscape, making India not only a competitor but a leader in the field of autonomous maritime navigation. With the Kochi Shipyard Ltd. already working with ME2ME, the center aims to attract more environmentally conscious startups and stakeholders. With volume in production, the team hopes to garner the interest of inland water transportation companies through reduced operational costs.\nFurthering the robustness of autonomous monitoring systems, the team has proposed a wave energy docking system that utilizes the kinetic energy of ocean waves to charge an electric vessel that fetches real time data that simply cannot be replicated on a lab scale setup. The advantage of its ‘in-situ’ nature would be realized in future research in a wide range of fields. Currently the team aims to complete development of their navigation systems and algorithms within the next one and a half years. By the end of three years, it visions field integration of the same, though that might attract some bureaucratic obstacles.\nAsk more about ME2ME on the\ncommunity.",

        "answer": "Introduction\nIIT Madras is renowned worldwide for its research-based academic programs, which have been quite successful in building a thriving research culture. Many undergraduate core courses help you develop a solid foundation to do research later. These courses often discuss active research questions to pique your interest in that domain. Along with the core courses, the graduate-level courses are designed to help students pursue a research career. Most of these courses have course projects and presentations that give you a taste of academic research.\nAs a B.Tech student, there are a lot of research opportunities ranging from UGRC (Undergraduate Research Credits) to Young Research Fellowship (YRF) and Bachelors' Thesis (BTP). If you are a Dual Degree (DD) student, you also have a compulsory final-year project where you get to work on a research problem for the entire duration of your final year. Working with renowned professors at IITM and their collaborators also helps you build a solid profile to pursue an MS/PhD in top universities.\nAbout the YRF\n‍\nThe Young Research Fellow program is a unique program with a mission to encourage highly motivated undergraduate students to embrace the vibrant ongoing research environment at IIT Madras. This year-long program is designed to provide immersive scientific exploration opportunities for the students. The participants can choose and execute research projects in any academic department or centre of excellence at IITM, purely based on their interests and aptitude. The respective faculty member will closely guide the students to ensure a successful and rewarding research endeavour.\nUGRC\n‍\nThis is an exciting opportunity allowing students to pursue independent research under the guidance of a faculty member. In short, a student should first sign up with a faculty member with a specific proposal of what (s)he expects to accomplish during the semester. The supervisor should ensure that the proposal entails an amount of work appropriate for the credit received. A report, due at the end of the course, should also serve as a useful experience in documentation and technical writing.  A B.Tech student can sign up for a maximum of three such courses throughout their program. Students can register for a maximum of one undergraduate research project per semester.\nHere\nare some pointers for navigating UGRC by Prof. Uday Khankhoje.\nInstitute of Eminence\n‍\nIIT Madras has also been formally recognised as an Institute of Eminence (IoE) under the GoI scheme. This prestigious recognition is a testament to the institute's commitment to excellence in higher education and research. With its new IoE status, IIT Madras has embarked on a journey to establish itself as a world-class teaching and research institution, focusing on a wide range of contemporary fields. A total of 68 research initiatives belonging to 21 identified technology clusters are presently underway.\nHere\nis an overview of the various clusters and initiatives.\nVoice your opinions on the\ncommunity\nand talk to students and alumni from IITM.",

This program encourages deserving students to pursue higher education while continuing to excel in their sports.\nTo be eligible for admission through this program, candidates must have secured a position in the Common Rank List (CRL) or category-wise rank list in the JEE (Advanced), and must have won at least one medal in any National/International-level sports competition in the last four years.\nA separate 'Sports Rank List' (SRL) will be prepared based on the total score obtained by the candidates based on their performance in a specific list of sports. The seat allotment will be done based on this list.\nThe admission process through SEA will require a student to qualify JEE (Advanced) but would not be through Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) portal rather through a separate portal operated by IIT Madras.

It provides a platform for students to interact, compete, and celebrate the diversity of talents within the IIT community. This event aims to allow some of the brightest minds in India to display their skills and achieve distinction by participating in a plethora of events that enrich the cultural sphere of IITs.\nIn contrast to the well-established Inter IIT Sports Meet, which has seen 53 editions, and the Inter IIT Tech Meet, with 12 editions so far (and the most recent one being hosted by IIT Madras), the Inter IIT Cultural Meet is a relatively new addition to the club, with the most recent one at IIT Kharagpur being the 6th edition of the meet. However, it is gradually making its mark.\nIIT Madras has a rich legacy at the Inter IIT Cultural Meet. In the most recent edition of Cultural Meet, the IITM contingent was announced as the winner of the Quiz Cup and the second runners-up of the Literary Arts Cup. The Inter IIT Cultural Meet 5.0, featuring around 3,200 students from various IITs, was held at IIT Madras in January 2023. This was the first cultural meet held after a break of two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with hosting, the IITM contingent had a podium finish, and they won the Literary Arts Cup.\nThe Inter-IIT contingent selections are open to the General Student Body (GSB) with each Sangam club conducting auditions for their respective contingent and events. Selections for various Inter-IIT contingents usually commence in early October, followed by months of meticulous preparation until the final event in December.\nOutside the Inter-IIT Cultural Meet, various cultural contingents from IITM have gone on to win the highest number of tournaments so far at multiple events including Mood Indigo, Nihilanth, Festember, Pravega, Riviera, just to name a few.\nAsk your questions to students and alumni on the\nAskIITM community\n.",

        "answer": "The student’s interests should be put at the highest level while selecting courses or streams. Having said that, based on current industry demand, the computer science stream records a higher placement percentage than the other streams. This does not mean that the other branches are not good, in fact, last year’s highest salary package went to a student from the mechanical engineering stream. There is good job security in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering jobs, and students from IIT Madras have landed jobs in some of the top companies in these branches, year after year.\nHere are some of the top recruiters from each branch:\n1. Computer Science and Engineering\nMicrosoft\nGoogle\nDa Vince\nGraviton\n2. Electrical Engineering\nTexas Instruments\nMicron technologies\nQualcomm\nSchneider Electric\n3. Mechanical Engineering\nBajaj\nWipro\nProcter and Gamble\nTata\nFor more information on 2022-23 placements, please check out the placement report\nhere\n.\nIn the long term, though, what matters is the student’s consistent effort to learn, up-skill, and be relevant to the job market. College life is the time when students find their real passion. IITM provides the necessary time, opportunities, and exposure for students to figure out their career paths, ultimately empowering students to build successful futures.\nWhile securing a good placement is one of the most crucial aspects of one's academic journey, it is also equally important to pursue your passion and do what you love.

        "tags": [
            "Academics"
        ],
        "answer": "A minor is an accreditation granted to you by the institution that certifies your competence in a secondary academic area unrelated to your \"major\" or the degree you are seeking. It is acknowledged on the transcripts and serves as proof that you are also quite proficient in the secondary field.\nMinors at IIT Madras\nAlmost a decade back, IIT-M had a system that required students to opt for a minor beforehand and mandatorily complete courses about it. But now, the system has been revoked with the influx of a large and varied range of electives, thus giving students the liberty to chart their path into a minor. According to the ongoing system, each minor would have some compulsory courses and a roster of electives, and a student has to take 4 courses, i.e. 36-40 credits, to claim the minor degree. From minor to minor, the requirements may differ - some may require a student to take one core course and 3 electives of the minor, while some may demand two core courses and two electives to be taken.\nMinor\ncan be taken in any course you want to - AI, Machine Learning, Applied Economics, Mathematics, Sociology, International Relations, and so on.\nHow to claim a Minor?\nA minor at IIT-M can be claimed by emailing the Dean of Academic Courses after you have completed all courses required to claim the minor or are in progress, by the date of claiming. Most of the engineering disciplines require students to have almost 72-90 unallotted credits to accommodate a minor and a fixed quorum for humanities electives. Students should complete the minor requirements by the seventh semester to claim it and add it to their resumes. This subtly conveys the strong message that by the third or fourth semester, one should have at least a general concept of the topic they wish to minor in.  A glimpse into the branch and category-wise credit requirements of\nB.Tech\nand\nDual Degree\nprograms can clarify the credit availability to claim a minor.\nNPTEL\nis another way to acquire a minor, provided they are used judiciously since there is a limit on the number of credits that can be gained and transferred via NPTEL. If a person makes careful use of all such avenues, it is even possible to minor in 2 disciplines, at least theoretically.\nDoes Your Branch Affect Your Choice of Minor?\nA student’s major branch does not pose any constraint in the choice of minor they take. The only requirement to claim a minor is to complete the required courses and thus there is no question of branch. A minor degree may be different from the major branch or be an allied degree, as the student wishes. There is no order of preference as to how minor courses have to be taken, as long as one is not a prerequisite for another. Students do not have to fret over mapping the course over semesters.\nWhy do a Minor?\nA minor can play a significant role in your résumé if you are inclined towards placements because it shows prospective employers that you have completed multiple courses in a certain field and have specialized abilities that may match what they are searching for. A minor also appears on your transcripts, making the process of \"cross-apping\" simpler. When someone decides to go for graduate studies (a Masters' or Ph.D.) in a subject unrelated to their Bachelor's degree, it is known as \"cross-apping.\" A minor in the area you want to change into is always helpful in situations like this. In addition, some minors might improve your total academic record, regardless of whether you decide to cross-apply. Regardless of such factors, a minor is a great way to delve deeper into a subject of your interest, which may be out of your core domain.\nAsk more about minor programs on our\ncommunity\n!",

        "answer": "Yes, the girls’ hostels are just as good as the boys’ hostels.\nHowever, with fewer girls’ hostels compared to the boys’ hostels in IIT Madras, it’s common to wonder if girls get the same level of safety, cleanliness, and security. But those concerns are pretty much unfounded. The girls’ hostels are just as great, offering comfy living conditions and top-notch facilities, no doubt about that.\nLocation\nAll girls' hostels are located in fairly green areas with proximity to messes, food courts, and general facilities like convenience stores. Four of them - Swarnamukhi, Sabarmati, Sharavati, and Sarayu - are clustered near the Vindhya mess and are very close to the Central Library as well. Students from these hostels can easily access services such as laundry, ironing, snacks, and refreshments. Tunga and Bhadra are located near the Himalaya Mess Halls and the Nilgiri mess. These hostels are at a prime location where facilities such as the Institute Gym and Sports Centre are nearby, not to mention the basketball and badminton courts.\nFacilities\nThe hostels have a fairly good number of single, double, and triple occupancy rooms, some with even quadruple occupancy rooms. Each wing of a hostel, comprising nearly 8 rooms, shares one bathroom, which has multiple stalls and restrooms. All the hostels are cleaned daily by the cleaning staff, and they even help students clean rooms on request. Each student would have one cot, one fan, one tube light, multiple charging ports, a cupboard, a table, and a chair given to them in every room. A LAN port is also provided to each student to access high-speed internet in the rooms.\nMost of the girls' hostels have sports rooms, gym rooms, and other recreational facilities such as TV and music systems in the common rooms. Equipment for tennis, table tennis, hockey, badminton, and even cricket is available in the hostels. Each floor has spacious dump rooms that can be used by students to store their stuff when they go home during vacations or on long internships. Some of the hostels have vending machines, which are restocked twice a day, and here’s the cool part - students from other hostels can use them too. Each bathroom has working washing machines, making life super convenient.\nSafety\nAll due care is taken to ensure the safety of the students. Lady guards are on duty 24*7 and assist students in various ways. All hotels have fingerprint access to ensure that no unauthorized person enters the hostels. No males, not even the parents of students, are allowed inside. Male laborers and other staff are accompanied by the hostel manager or other officials to ensure the safety of the students, while working or during maintenance work in rooms, corridors, or washrooms. Security patrolling is active at night to ensure that no untoward incidents happen.\nThe hostels at IITM support personal growth and interests by providing necessary facilities and continually improving the infrastructure. These efforts contribute to creating a comfortable and memorable hostel life for the students.\nIs there anything else you wish to know about IITM?

        "answer": "Sporting Environment @ IIT Madras\nSports at IITM attract much interest, not just from students on campus but also from institutions across the city and the nation. The academic calendar is jam-packed with sporting events, including intercollegiate and inter-IIT competitions and intra- and inter-hostel contests. Excellent facilities are offered, including an Olympic-caliber swimming pool, a fully-stocked gym, the outstanding IIT-Chemplast cricket facility, the sizable Manohar C. Watsa stadium, and a high-tech multipurpose indoor stadium with a wood floor in the Student Activity Centre (SAC). The untiring commitment and enthusiasm of the student community, with encouragement and guidance from the faculty, has created tremendous opportunities for students to hone their talents.\nSchroeter - The Sports Battle of the Hostels\nThe sports secretaries of the\n21 hostels\nplan a variety of indoor and outdoor intra-hostel competitions throughout the year, including cricket, badminton, volleyball, throwball, carrom, chess, and others. The best teams from each hostel compete for the Schroeter Cup, which is given to the hostel that earned the most points across all inter-hostel competitions held over the academic year. The objectives of the inter-hostel sports and games are to encourage sportsmanship, promote friendly relations and character development among the students of the various hostels, and foster a close association among them. Separate championships are conducted for boys and girls in Schroeter.\nWomen's Schroeter\nWomen’s Schroeter is conducted in the following events:\nAthletics\nBadminton\nBasketball\nChess\nSwimming\nTable Tennis\nTennis\nVolleyball\nMen's Schroeter\nMen’s Schroeter is conducted in all of the above and more sports, including:\nCricket\nFootball\nHockey\nSquash\nWater Polo\nWeightlifting\nThe Men's and Women's Schroeter Trophies are given out to the hostels that earn the most points in the boys' and girls' events, respectively. If there is a tie for the Schroeter Trophy, the team with the most first places (Gold) in team events decides the tie for first place in the overall championship.\nWho Wins the Schroeter?\nIn team games, trophies and medals are awarded to the winners, the runners-up, and the second runners-up of each competition. Certificates of merit are awarded to the winners, the runners-up, the second runners-up, and the fourth place of each match, signed by the Chairman, the Convener, and the Organizing Secretary of the Inter Hostel Sports Meet. In individual events like athletics, weightlifting, swimming, etc., merit certificates are awarded up to fourth place and medals to third place. The passion and zest displayed during these matches have to be seen to be believed. Gymkhana Day marks the end of all sports activities for the academic year, with the laurels and accolades awarded to the winners and the champion hostels.\nWhat Does It Mean to Win the Schroeter?\nPutting in weeks of training to give one’s best for their hostel and seeing those efforts culminate into bringing the rolling championship to the hostel is one of the most cherished moments for sports enthusiasts across IIT Madras. With every hostel turning up in the stadium and pavilions to cheer for their players, the unified feeling of triumph when someone from your hostel brings home laurels cannot be put into words.\nLifting Schroeter's trophy is an exhilarating experience that fills the heart with indescribable joy and pride.\nAs the crowd erupts in thunderous applause, a surge of adrenaline courses through the veins, amplifying the euphoria of victory. Every moment of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice becomes worthwhile in that triumphant instant. The trophy becomes a tangible symbol of success, representing the culmination of relentless training, teamwork, and determination. It is a testament to the unwavering spirit and the relentless pursuit of perfection. The joyous tears, jubilant embraces, and broad smiles on the stage and the bowl at the Student Activity Centre on Gymkhana Day create memories that will forever be etched in the soul of every student, setting off the motivation to do better in the next Schroeter, and for life.\nPenny for your thoughts?

        ],
        "answer": "College life would be sparse without cultural events and competitions. IIT Madras has a vibrant cultural scene facilitated by the conglomeration of about 16 activity clubs called Sangam. You name it; we have it: dance, music, classical arts, drama, fashion, writing, oratory, fine arts, comedy, e-sports, quizzing, word games, media, design and VFX, and more.\nWhat is LitSoc?\nLit Soc is an epic year-long inter-hostel battle royale in all cultural activities conducted by the respective clubs. All the hostels go head to head throughout the academic year and battle it out with each other. By winning competitions with different points, the hostels aim to get the necessary particulars to take the LitSoc Cup home at the end of the year and be crowned champion. LitSoc stands for Literary Society. In its formative years, it started with only literary competitions, but with time, it grew bigger and brought under its wings multiple cultural competitions.\nWhat makes LitSoc popular?\nLitSoc took a slight hit with the online edition during the pandemic. However, the past year has witnessed a tremendous revival of the zeal of the competition. Around 40 events are planned per year. Flagged off by the most significant event combining a treasure hunt and a show of hostel solidarity called Queen of Sheba, the LitSoc competitions extend through the odd and even semesters. More events are planned in the odd semester compared to the even semester. Most individual events happen in the odd semester, while more group events are scheduled in the even semester. Winners of the events get certificates and medals, and the events are judged by experts of the art from outside. There have also been instances of students being offered a chance to perform outside after giving mesmerizing performances during LitSoc and winning the judges’ hearts. Some popular and evergreen events of LitSoc are Queen of Sheba, Hostel Choreo Night, Short-Film Making and Screening, Band Performances, and many more.\nDoes LitSoc foster hostel bonding and help forge friendships?\nLitSoc is not just about winning a competition but about breathing in the “hostel feels,” as the Institute lingo goes. People who may not have even seen each other in the hostel might team up to win those precious points for the hostel to top the scoreboard and become inseparable in the process. The clubs and outreach committees spread the word about every event through club Instagram pages, Sangam Instagram pages, and especially the student mail through unique posters and official rulebooks. The drive to score the maximum for one’s hostel intensifies as LitSoc progresses. Freshers have special awards for being active throughout LitSoc and earning points for the hostel.\nWhy LitSoc?\nLitSoc promotes the growth of art among the student community. People shed all apprehensions and try their hand at new activities to bag those participation points, if not more. Cheering for your hostels and screaming the hostels’ names during group events at the Student Activities Centre or any other venue is an exhilarating experience. Watching your hostel representatives go on stage to bring home the massive LitSoc Championship trophy is an experience that cannot be described in words. The love, the appreciation, and, most importantly, the bonds created during LitSoc are something every student of IIT Madras would cherish and look back fondly upon when they enter the wide world.\nTell us what you think about culturals on the\nAskIITM Community.",

        "answer": "Honestly, it is hard to comment on the nature of the roommate that you will be getting, but I can safely say that they will be one of your first best friends of your college life. In your first year, roommates will be allotted based on roll numbers, which is considered to be a fair practice, the hostels being Mandakini for boys and Swarnamukhi for girls. The rooms are well-lit and have good ventilation. First-years and second-years will be allotted double- or triple-sharing rooms. The rooms are spacious with a fan, a tubelight and a bed for each student. Enough cupboard compartments are also available in the room as per occupancy. A number of charging points are available in the room with LAN ports for each student, to avail the internet.\nHaving a roommate, especially in the first year helps you shed your insecurities by bonding with someone. While freshers are allotted rooms and roommates by the hostel authorities, they can choose to have another roommate in the second year. Your roommates will be the first people you wake up to see in the morning, while most of the time they would be the ones to wake you up. You figure out things as a group, explore the campus, be curious, answer each others’ doubts, hear each others’ stories, gossip late nights, binge-watch shows together, have fights, copy assignments, etc. You do it all together. They comfort you when you are down, and you are expected to do the same. At times it might be hard initially to get along as some of them turn out to be introverts (including you). But once the barrier is broken (and it will be), there is no turning back.\nThe shared living experience instils discipline as it is your responsibility along with your roommate to keep your room neat. You take turns and clean the room, after sharing expenses and buying room essentials. Roommates are a great help when you fall sick; they get you medicines and food, and if things get out of hand, inform the concerned people and accompany you to the Institute hospital. Having a roommate gives you a first-hand experience of negotiating differences and making small adjustments to make them feel comfortable. Having a roommate who understands you can go a long way in keeping your mind healthy as well.\nIn order to build a bond with your roommate, you can choose to decorate the room together, making it your “own” space, you can buy snacks collectively and binge on them while watching a movie on a weekend together in your room or in the OAT. You can go to dinner with your roommate and other friends, thus helping them make new friends as well. You can order in and have food together. As time progresses, you get used to borrowing each others’ clothes and things. Your roommate can become your study partner who explains things you don't understand and learns from you. You can visit other friends’ rooms together for casual chit-chat. Having a roommate who has good chemistry with you and shares common interests may make your first year a smooth ride. If you get a roommate whose interests are different, you may learn something new from them.\nThe roommate culture is truly amazing because when no one else is there, all you have got is each other’s back. They are your first family here and most likely will go on to be best friends for life.\nShare your thoughts on roommates on the\nAskIITM Community\n!",

        "answer": "The hostel accommodation at IIT Madras varies according to the year and program. First-year undergraduates are allotted Mandakini (for boys) or Swarnamukhi (for girls). At the beginning of the third semester, they are allotted a different hostel, double-sharing being the criteria. The students get to choose their roommates, and 7-8 rooms adjacent to each other form a wing.\nStudents are shifted in their third year to their final hostel, where they stay until graduation. The allocation is single/triple, based on preference. Postgraduate students are allotted single rooms.\nFacilities\nThe hostel rooms are equipped with a table, a chair, a shelf, and a bed (without a mattress). Students get an almirah for storage. The room also has an overhead fan and multiple lights. A high-speed LAN network is provided, with multiple ports in case of double/triple sharing. Students, however, are required to buy their own LAN cables. Power cuts, though  infrequent, happen and the electricity is restored in a matter of minutes in such instances. The larger tower hostels have lifts for convenience. The hostel also provides mosquito nets for windows.\nThere are multiple common restrooms located on each floor. A set of 7-8 rooms get to share washing machines (automatic and semi-automatic). Students are responsible for their laundry and room maintenance. There is a cleaning staff that take care of all the common areas, including restrooms, corridors, and floors, but the rooms have to be cleaned by the students themselves. However, if there are pre-existing problems with dirt or paint, hostel management can be called for assistance.\nThe hostels also have an outdoor central badminton court, music rooms, reading rooms, and TV rooms. Gyms are common for everyone. Mandakini has multiple badminton courts on the premises. Some hostels also have vending machines inside, accessible 24*7!\nIn case of any issues, students can contact the hostel manager who strive for prompt resolution.\nIn addition to the excellent facilities, hostel life will be an experience that every student will treasure for a lifetime. Waking up beside friends, having food, going to classes together, barging into each other's rooms, causing a stir, etc., are somethings that will transform into core memories.\nFor more queries, please visit the\nAskIITM Community\n.\nHere is a vlog by an IITM student as he takes you through the hostels, their facilities, and students’ feedback:\n(This video is not made by AskIITM - it has been attached for viewing purposes only.

        "answer": "While exploring pictures of IIT Madras on the internet, both in general and on the institute websites, one would find numerous pictures of monkeys, birds, and different types of deer, not to mention the intense greenery. This is the most visible evidence of the fact that IIT Madras has a rich variety of wildlife in its premises, which only adds to the natural grandeur of the campus. You can spot herds of deer on your walk along the Gajendra Circle, and you would most probably see monkeys frequenting your hostel and the surroundings during the day. The IIT Madras campus is home to many animals which are not common in a busy city like Chennai.\nBiodiversity\nBoth Guindy National Park and the IIT campus have about 300 species of trees and plants with quite a large number of native wild species, which are unique to the tropical, dry evergreen vegetation. This is also one of the least common types of vegetation found in India. Hence, it is very important to protect the native wild species for the healthy future of the place. After the establishment of IIT, a lot of native species were replaced by exotic, non-regional avenue trees and garden plants.  A typical example from the campus is the introduced species, Prosopis juliflora or 'velikkathan'. Though it is not a native species to Coromandel coast, it has become an ideal habitat for a host of birds like open-billed storks and herons near the oxidation pond. Similarly, it provides food for animals like blackbuck and deer during the summer months. An example of a plant that has been showing adverse reactions is 'Gulmohar'. These trees are mostly spread by stem cuttings and hence do not have a tap root system. They have been found to be poor survivors during heavy winds and rains. Valuable and rare herbs are also found in some corners. An approximate total of 20 herbs have been recorded. Rare and common mushrooms and other fungi can also be seen in IIT Madras.\nOnly at IITM\nThe campus boasts of being the habitat to one of the most elegant antelopes in the world - the Blackbuck. It also has the graceful Spotted Deer (Cheetal). The vast campus houses a lot of other smaller and exquisite life forms that play a major role in the biodiversity of the campus Squirrels and mongoose are also commonly seen on the campus. Though relatively rare, sightings of snakes like cobras and rat snakes have been reported on occasion. 42 species of butterflies have been identified in the campus including the vibrant blue tiger, banded peacock, baron, leopard, cupid and many more. Around 25 species of insects, from the most common silverfish to stick insects, beetles and colorful bugs are also found in IIT Madras.\nAvian Friends\nThe campus is home to numerous resident and migratory birds, thanks to its proximity to the Adyar River and the Guindy National Park. Birds such as parakeets, mynas, peafowls, spotted owlets, hoopoes, and several species of water birds can be spotted in and around the campus. The lush greenery, trees, and open spaces attract these avian visitors. Almost 86-90 species of birds have been reportedly spotted in IIT Madras including storks, drongoes, moorhens, kingfishers, kites etc.\nPrakriti\nIIT Madras has a Wildlife Club named Prakriti which aims at the conservation of the invaluable natural wealth of the campus. They spread awareness about the need to conserve the flora and fauna to maintain the ecological balance, through various means like billboards, workshops,etc. They sensitize freshers about the importance of the wildlife on campus and also conduct campaigns and drives for removal of non-biodegradable waste and protect the animals.\nConservation\nIIT Madras has strictly demarcated areas where no humans or vehicles are allowed, so as to not disturb the sanctity of the wildlife inhabiting the spaces. Animal rescue is also prompt in the event of any animal being injured or even sick. Security is also strict to ensure that no illegal activities pertaining to animals happen. Vehicles are checked at the exit to make sure that no weapons that can harm life are being carried and also to prevent activities like hunting and poaching. IIT Madras is a place that spreads the message that technology can coexist in harmony and develop without harming the environment and all forms of life calling it home.\nShare your thoughts on the\nAskIITM Community.",

        "answer": "Students who go to hostels and coaching centers away from the comfort of their homes to crack JEE and reach an IIT would be curious about the type of facilities, especially the food, that their “dream institute” offers. At IIT Madras, you need not have such worries since the variety of food in the messes is comforting and satisfying. There are three substantial mess complexes: Himalaya, Vindhya, and Nilgiri, with 10-11 messes and food courts.\nWhat do the messes provide?\nThe messes have fingerprint access, and people use their ID cards in the food courts to pay for the food they order. There are separate North and South messes, which offer options to the students to stick to familiar tastes or to opt for something else if they feel the need for a change. Being in Chennai doesn't mean Idli and Dosa are your only options. The day's three meals are sumptuous, and the menu is wide-ranging. Indian food like poori-bhaji, roti, poha, idiyappam, appam, uthappam, upma, etc., with bread, cornflakes, eggs, sprouts, milk, tea, coffee, and even fruits are found on the breakfast menus. Lunch has delicious servings of chapati, dal, rice, different types of vegetable dishes, and paneer, and some staple South Indian curries and sides are provided in the South messes. Extras like chicken dishes and others can be availed at mess using extra money paid in the iKollege Portal using the student ID card. Dinner is also similarly versatile, with a green salad and fruit juices available. One may also enjoy desserts like gulab jamun or ice cream in the food courts or as extras. In addition, evening tea is provided, and some messes have snacks. A Jain mess is also available for students wishing to have Jain food. All dietary requirements of the students are met in the messes of IIT Madras with no compromise on quality or nutrition.\nHow does the mess registration portal work?\nThe mess registration process at present is managed by the conceptualized iKollege portal, keeping in mind the introduction of a new system called Meal Billing, where a student pays only for the meals they eat. A rough estimate of the percentage of registered students dining in a particular mess is seventy-five percent, meaning introducing such a system will result in significant student savings. The iKollege system ideally reduces the amount of wasted food in the mess, as the caterer will be aware of the approximate number of diners. Also, students have the benefit of not paying for the meals they don’t have.\nHow to facilitate mess registration?\nStudents can make use of the mess registration facility on the iKollege portal on the dates prescribed by the Office of Hostel Management and register messes of their choice in order of preference. Every attempt is made to provide all students with their first choices. The rare incident of a student being allocated another mess may be due to the mess capacity and many students opting for it before. A first-come, first-serve basis is followed in the allocation of the mess of first preference. Students may change messes every one or two months. Mess registration for vacation stay is also done through the portal, provided the student has accommodation and permission to stay from the concerned authorities, like Deans, HoDs or project guides.\nWhat makes IIT Madras's mess system unique?\nWhile some IITs have mess halls in each hostel, IIT Madras mostly has familiar dining halls with capacities as high as 1500. This is an opportunity to interact with students across departments and years of study since no fixed population would frequent a particular mess. International students, too, like the food offered at IIT Madras. The menu offers variety throughout the week, thus avoiding monotony in taste. Students also have the facility to claim mess rebates in case of valid reasons for not eating at the mess, such as Ramadan fasting or health issues requiring recovery away from the Institute. The mess system in IIT Madras is constantly being improved - in terms of food quality, management, seating capacity, and so on to provide the best services to the students, and to enable them to be productive in campus life.\nVoice your opinion on the\nAskIITM Community\n.",

        "answer": "Visit IIT Madras at any time of the day - there would be a reasonable number of students on the roads. Students at the institute often say that Insti comes alive at night, which is true. After the day’s hustle, most students prefer to leave their hostels for a nice walk on the campus roads to rejuvenate. The campus's natural beauty and fresh air feel different at night, as it gets slightly more relaxed, relieving the Chennai heat.\nInfrastructure\nAll the roads, buildings, and bus stops are well-lit at night to facilitate easy mobility for the students. Many students, especially PG and Ph.D. scholars, work in labs late into the night, which highly benefits them. Institute buses run till 10 PM, and one may avail of the facility even at night by calling the security section. The security service is well-rounded as well. Guards are placed where the lighting is insufficient and on roads leading to remote paths to assist students. The contact details of the Chief Security Officer and other personnel are available on the student portal, and one may report an issue at any time. The Institute Police also conducts regular rounds of patrolling at night to ensure the safety of students.\nInstitutional Facilities\nIIT Madras has a robust\nWomen’s Forum\nto address the issues female students face—academic, social, physical, or mental health-related issues. Life Skills courses provided to first-years include a POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) program to make IIT Madras a safe place with equal opportunity for all to agree or to disagree, irrespective of gender. There is a Committee for preventing and redressing sexual harassment called\nC-CASH\n. The members of the Complaints Committee deal with the complaints of sexual harassment by the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court of India relating to sexual harassment of women workers at workplaces and students, as given below. In addition to the above, the Chairman, Chief Security Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Chairman (CCW), Chairperson (Women’s Forum), Student General Secretary/Hostel Affairs Secretary will be invited to the meeting, as and when required by the Chairperson of C-CASH.\nThe Complaint Committee at IIT Madras has been set up to provide women with an appropriate complaint mechanism against unwelcome sexually determined behavior, whether directly or by implication. It is in line with the Supreme Court’s ruling on sexual harassment in the workplace being a violation of women’s fundamental right to a safe working environment. One can report any case of sexual harassment by writing in the mail or contacting members of C-CASH via any means. They would get the complainant within 24 hours and provide a private and safe environment to disclose any misbehavior or harassment they were subjected to. Action will be taken against the perpetrator after due inquiry. C-CASH also protects the complainant from victimization or discrimination. The body also works to create awareness and gender sensitization among the students and staff of IIT Madras.\nOutside IITM\nChennai is a safe city for women in general, and students may go out for work or personal needs at night by registering an entry at their hostels. IIT Madras is a haven for all its students and has proper mechanisms to prevent and address any untoward happenings, which are rare.\nDrop your thoughts on the\nAskIITM Community\n.",

        "answer": "Being in one of the top universities in the country, sometimes it can get hard to cope with the peer pressure and the competitive environment that the campus creates. Many students take time to adjust to their new environment, with new people and new life. Every period of a student’s college experience - their initial days, academics, the internship season, projects, placement, etc - poses unique challenges that not all would be able to overcome.\nIIT Madras takes every step to ensure that the students are not alone in the time of their misery. The mental health of their students is given utmost importance, just like their physical health. Here are the bodies under the wellness community center that work towards ensuring students’ mental well-being:\nSAATHI\n: A platform focusing on the well-being and self-growth of the students, Saathi raises awareness on the campus about various pertinent issues and plans several informal gatherings, lectures, and sessions, open to all.\nMITR\n: MITR provides peer counseling to distressed students and collaborates with different agencies in the IITM community. The motto of MITR is ‘No one on the campus should be unattended in their emotional distress’.\nThe Wellness Centre, IITM\n: A body of licensed mental health professionals with whom students can schedule an appointment when they are feeling the need to talk to someone.\nOmbuds for students: Additionally, IIT-Madras appointed former director general of police of Tamil Nadu and retired IPS officer G Thilakavathi as “Student Ombuds” to oversee and address concerns related to students’ grievances, safety, and disciplinary matters.

The campus boasts of its varied range of diversity, having students from almost all parts of the country. There is no regionalism and a single-language dominance, and nobody is treated as inferior to others based on the language they speak.\nHere are certain aspects that students from North India might be apprehensive about:\nStaff\nAll of the staff inside the campus understand Hindi enough to communicate with the students. Half of the working personnel here are from North India, hence there are no gaps in communication. Securities, Vendors, Cafe serving crew, etc provide a healthy surrounding and are very helpful.\nFood\nFood can be one of the greatest fears while studying in another state. IITM’s mess functions in such a way that no student is forced to eat whatever is served to them. There are a wide variety of North, South, and Jain Caterers that are offered to students to choose from, along with a mess food court. The in-campus food courts contain a wide array of dishes to taste, offered at a fair price. There is also a late-night food truck to satisfy odd-time cravings!\nAcademics\nThe medium of instruction is English. The course content, materials shared and the lectures are in English, eliminating any language-related concerns. However, the students are offered courses on a wide variety of other languages to learn.\nCulture\n‍\nThere are committees from every part of the country, like the Marathi Mitra Mandal, Kerala Kala Samiti, Kannada Samskruthika Sangha, etc., that bring together people from the same state to engage in year-round interactions and organize events. From Lohri to Onam, every major festival is celebrated, adorning the entire campus with festive lights throughout the year.\nIIT Madras is a reflection of the entire City of Chennai with respect to how people from other states are treated.

        "answer": "What is an IDDD?\nThe Interdisciplinary Dual Degree (IDDD) program at IIT Madras is a unique academic program that allows students to pursue a Bachelor's and Master's degree simultaneously in different disciplines. The program is designed to promote interdisciplinary learning and research, enabling students to gain expertise in multiple fields.\nThe program typically extends for five years and follows a structured curriculum that includes core courses from both disciplines as well as elective courses. Students are required to complete a certain number of credits in each discipline to fulfill the degree requirements.\nAt the end of the 5th semester, a student can convert their 4-yr BTech degree into a 5-yr Dual degree by opting for an IDDD - Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree, provided their CGPA is above 8.0. The student will get a BTech in the original branch and an MTech in the IDDD branch.\nHow is IDDD different from DD?\nIn the Dual Degree program, students typically pursue degrees within the same discipline or closely related disciplines. For example, a student might pursue a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. The focus is on gaining in-depth knowledge and specialization in a specific field.\nIn contrast, the IDDD program allows students to combine undergraduate studies in one discipline with postgraduate studies in a different discipline. This enables them to explore diverse academic interests and gain expertise in multiple fields. For example, a student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering can pursue a Master’s degree in Data Science.\nIDDD options\nThe different IDDD programs currently offered at IIT Madras are:\nAdvanced Materials and Nanotechnology\nComplex Systems and Dynamics\nBiomedical Engineering\nComputational Engineering\nCyber-Physical Systems\nData Science\nElectric Vehicles\nEnergy Systems\nRobotics\nQuantum Science and Technology\nQuantitative Finance\nPublic Policy\nTech MBA\nBenefits of IDDD\nThe Interdisciplinary Dual Degree (IDDD) program offers several benefits to students who choose to pursue it:\nThe IDDD program allows students to gain expertise in multiple disciplines. By studying different fields simultaneously, students develop a broader knowledge base, enabling them to make connections between diverse subjects. This interdisciplinary perspective can foster creative problem-solving and innovative thinking.\nGraduates of the IDDD program often possess a unique skill set that combines knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. This can make them attractive to employers who value individuals with diverse backgrounds and the ability to work across different domains. The program opens up a wider range of career opportunities that may span various industries or even intersecting areas of specialization.\nThe IDDD program nurtures an environment for interdisciplinary research and innovation. Students are encouraged to explore the intersections between different fields, identifying new approaches and solutions to complex problems; this interdisciplinary mindset can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in various domains.\nDo you have any thoughts to share on IDDDs?

        "answer": "Financial limitations are sometimes one of the biggest obstacles for students when seeking higher education. After realizing this challenge, IIT Madras has made outstanding efforts to ensure students have access to a top-notch education regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances. IIT Madras has developed an atmosphere that encourages and empowers students to achieve in their academic endeavors through various scholarships and financial aid programs.\nScholarships at IIT Madras\nIIT Madras encourages deserving students by providing different types of scholarships. The Institute also helps students requiring financial help with selective scholarship amounts and fee waivers. Some special scholarship schemes exist for SC, ST, and female students. Previous alums of the institute give some scholarships, while others are from companies and the Government of India. There are procedures for obtaining the scholarship, and every scholarship application is thoroughly checked and verified before approval.\nInstitute Scholarships\nThe following are the scholarships provided by the Institute:\nInstitute Merit-cum-Means Scholarship\nInstitute Free Studentship\nInstitute Notional Prize\nInstitute SC/ST Scholarship\nGirish Ready Scholarship\nIndian Women’s Association at Bonn Scholarship\nSri V Ranga Raju Memorial Scholarship\nKanchi Kamakoti Jagadguru Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi Endowment Award\nM Sankaraiah and M Saradha (Mithigiri) Scholarship\nDr. K Vasanth Rau Scholarship\nOther Scholarships\nOther Scholarships available at IIT Madras are:\nMinistry of Social Justice and Empowerment, GoI. - Central Sector Scholarship For SC students\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs, GoI. - Central Sector Scholarship For ST students\nMinistry of Minority Affairs, GoI Meritcum-Means Scholarship\nMHRD scholarship for single Girl child\nPratibha Scholarship of Govt. of Andhra Pradesh\nAditya Birla Scholarship\nInlakhs Scholarship\nOPJEMS\nST Engineering Scholarship\nShipping Corporation of India Scholarship\nTODAI Scholarship\nNissan Scholarship\nDAE, DGFS Scholarship by DRDO\nIIT Madras 72 batch Scholarship\nInspire Scholarship (Department of Science and Technology, Government of India)\nSSAN Ananya Educational trust\nDetails regarding eligibility and scholarship amount can be found\nhere\n.\nDoes IIT Madras offer Semester Exchanges with Foreign Universities?\nIITM also offers its students the option to study one semester abroad at a prestigious university. If a student applies for this exchange program, the team at IITM tries their best to get them a scholarship to cover the entire semester cost. This is based on the student's academic performance, co-curricular activities, and overall performance.\nDoes IIT Madras offer any Financial Aid to International Students?\nMany international students apply to IIT Madras primarily through scholarship programs like the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and Study in India (SII). Of these, the brightest candidates clear our stringent selection processes and are given an offer letter (approximately 10% of the applicants). However, only 20% of this pool are awarded a scholarship and join. The rest can only pursue a degree at IIT Madras with a scholarship, given their financial circumstances. IIT Madras has launched nine MTech programs for international students in topical areas and cutting-edge science and technology to combat this challenge. These programs include cyber-physical systems, data sciences, quantum computing, etc. The Institute envisions providing scholarships to foreign M.Tech students to cover tuition fees and living expenses on par with domestic students' current HTTA and HTRA pay.\nFurther details regarding the Scholarship program for international students can be found\nhere\n.\nDiscuss further on this topic on our\ncommunity\n!",

While some might not be particular about the location - as long as they get their desired branch — some students tend to strive towards the ‘best’ institute according to them. A ranking is always the first among many criteria that students look at: for many, the higher the rank, the better the institute. Furthermore, rankings, especially NIRF, become a tool to compare different institutes of repute.\nAt this juncture, it might be beneficial for parents and students to take a step forward, and look at the scores of individual institutes by the different parameters, to get a picture of which institute is best suited to the outcome they expect.\nSub-parameters: TLR\nChoosing an institute involves considering priorities: a high TLR (Teaching, Learning, and Resources) score signifies experienced faculty, advanced resources, and structured curricula, offering a conducive learning environment. IITM provides excellent teaching quality and infrastructure excellence for their child's academic experience, indicated by the scores, and stands as a top choice for parents and students alike.\nSub-parameters: OI\nOutreach and Inclusivity (OI) is a critical parameter that aids in assessing campus inclusivity, institutional support for minorities or marginalized groups, and overcoming challenges - economic, social, or physical - impacting academic pursuits. OI scores provide insight into potential financial assistance sources, essential for parents facing difficulties in funding their child's education.\nSub-parameters: RP\nIf students and parents want to compare institutes based on their research capabilities, RP (Research and Professional Practice) is the parameter to look at. These scores, based on research publications, patents, and project quality, help students inclined toward research identify institutes offering ample research opportunities and potential projects.\nSub-parameters: GO\nNIRF's Graduation Outcomes (GO) parameter rates institutes based on career development programs, placement statistics, funding, and median salaries. This indicator highlights an institute's support for entrepreneurship, innovation, and higher education. Parents seeking institutions fostering innovation, start-ups, or emphasizing placements can use GO rankings to gauge an institute's offerings.\nSub-parameters: Perception\nNIRF's Perception rankings reflect public, industry, and academic trust in an institute. These qualitative surveys gauge industry, peer, and public perception, aiding parents in understanding an institute's academic standing and industry recognition. A favorable perception indicates promising professional prospects for students, crucial for parental considerations.\nFor details on NIRF, rankings, and more, visit\nhere\n.\nIIT Madras, with a cumulative top score from all the sub-parameters (evidently ranked 1) is the best institute to study with a Holistic education, advanced facilities, and a very good research culture. Not only on the academic front, but the institute also contributes significantly to developing students’ interpersonal skills, leadership qualities, and physical and mental health - ultimately making them better individuals for the future.\nIf you have more questions on NIRF or rankings, please ask our community -\nAskIITM community.",

        "tags": [
            "Academics"
        ],
        "answer": "Electives are courses or subjects that students can choose to study based on their personal interests or career goals. Unlike mandatory or core courses, which are required for graduation or to fulfill specific academic requirements, electives provide students with the flexibility to explore different areas of study outside of their major or core curriculum.\nDefining Electives\nIIT Madras offers a wide range of disciplines and specialized programs. By selecting courses that suit their interests, career objectives, and ability, electives give students the freedom to tailor their education. Students can customize their educational experience and gain competence in a variety of subject areas owing to this customization. In an institute of national importance like IIT Madras, offering programs in diverse streams and subjects, electives promote the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach, enabling students to think critically, make connections across disciplines, and tackle complex problems from a multidimensional perspective. IIT Madras offers a diverse range of electives spanning humanities, social sciences, management, entrepreneurship, and more - this arrangement opens up avenues for students in engineering disciplines to delve deeper into these domains, and complement their core subject knowledge.\nWhy Electives?\nMany JEE aspirants across the country spend 2-3 years preparing for the exam, that would ultimately land them in their dream institute. In the years that go into studying and preparing oneself, one has to devote their complete focus to mastering the concepts from the science stream that form the syllabus of the entrance exam, therefore leaving them negligible time to explore other subjects or areas of study that they might be interested in.  IIT Madras recognizes the importance of nurturing students' curiosity and supporting their individual growth. By offering a variety of electives, the institute encourages students to develop their unique talents and explore their potential beyond the confines of their core curriculum. These electives are also aimed at making students industry-ready with a versatile skill set and knowledge base, boosting their employability. Electives in emerging areas such as data science, artificial intelligence, sustainability, and entrepreneurship help students acquire their desired careers. IIT Madras encourages students to pursue research in their areas of interest. Elective courses often provide a platform for students to work closely with faculty members and peers from different disciplines and gain research experience in the same.\nHow to assess and choose Electives?\nStudents may often have doubts about the relevance of electives to their core course in terms of pre-requisites or outcomes; or about the quality of the course and the instructor. At IIT Madras, the course registration portal displays all such particulars at the time of registration, to give students an idea of what to expect. A reasonable time frame is set for the registration process, giving people the opportunity to interact with others about the course and the instructor. The slot system ensures that students may opt for electives that do not overlap with other courses. There is no question of inability to pursue an elective since the curriculum prescribes it in the first place. Cons of electives such as work overload is overcome by the add/drop option available to students, often into the middle of the semester.\nElectives at IIT Madras\nThe\ncurriculum\nfor\nB.Tech.\nand\nDual Degree\nstudents has been revised to include many more electives. There is a significant increase in the number of electives that were allowed in the old curriculum. Students have flexibility in choosing electives from other departments starting as early as in their third semester. To enable students to have a choice in electives that they wish to pursue, all departments are requested to allow (a fixed number of) students from other departments in all their courses, including core courses. Many branches prescribe\nHumanities electives\nin their curriculum and the Humanities Department offers electives across disciplines like economics, literature, foreign languages, history, politics, international studies, sociology, statistics, etc. Similarly, different departments offer their department electives, some of which may be exclusive to students of the particular department and some which will be accessible to all, called free electives. For instance, electives such as AI and data science are department/free electives offered by the CSE department.\nHow do electives translate into a minor degree?\nThere are self-study elective courses and minor stream electives, in which students may pursue up to 4 electives in a specific domain and claim a minor degree in it upon graduation, helping students create a wider roster of careers for themselves to choose from. These may act as boosters on their resumes while applying for internships and jobs, and they might even acquire a major in the subject in the future. Adding to the advantages, electives that align with personal interests can contribute to overall personal growth, satisfaction, and well-being. For some, an elective course might be a recluse from the daily grind of the routine core courses. Engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment can enhance overall happiness and positively impact academic performance.\nIf you have more questions on this topic, please visit our community -\nAskIITM community.",
